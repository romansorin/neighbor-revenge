# neighbor-revenge
Initially a project to annoy my neighbors over incessant smoking that leaks into my home, which quickly turned into a Flask app that I could remotely trigger my Raspberry Pi with. Didn't finish the remote code/script execution portion, but Geckodriver is properly triggered on the server by any client on/off network.
